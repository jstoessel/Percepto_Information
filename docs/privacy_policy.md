## Percepto App - Privacy Policy
Jordan Stoessel built the Percepto! mobile app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided as a senior project for Worcester Polytechnic Institute’s Computer Science degree at no cost and is intended for use as is.
This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.
If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at Percepto! unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
# Information Collection and Use
While using the application, I request your device token for sending push notifications from a Firebase topic. The information that I request will be handled by Google Firebase to automatically send push notifications for users within specific lobbies. All information that is inputted, including the device token, will be discarded upon exit or after 24 hours of being inputted. The application nor I will make use of any inputted information other than the intended purpose of allowing users to join lobbies, display custom names to others within a lobby, and allowing users to receive vibration notifications.
The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.

# Service Providers
I may be required to allow Worcester Polytechnic Institute to handle the application due to the following reasons:
- As a requirement for submitting the senior project
- To run the application on my behalf
- To perform Service-related services; or
- To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
I want to inform users of this Service that Worcester Polytechnic Institute may have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
# Security
I value your trust in utilizing our application, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting your device token and all arbitrary inputs with it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security. The security of our applications is based on Google Firebase’s security, so there shouldn’t be much cause for worry.
# Children’s Privacy
These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age. If users input sensitive information, it is recommended that the user exit the lobby they are in so their information could be removed from the database as soon as possible. All stored information will be systematically removed after at least 24 hours.
# Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
This policy is effective as of 2021-02-22
