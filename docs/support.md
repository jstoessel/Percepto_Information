## Welcome to Percepto Support!

It's unfortunate that something went wrong, but typically fixes can be done by reinstalling the application and reconfiguring the settings from the "Setting Up" page. If your problem goes beyond this solution please feel free to contact me at jstoessel@wpi.edu and provide your email address, current device, device's current version, and the problem that you are experiencing. There might have been something that I missed so I'll work to correct this.
